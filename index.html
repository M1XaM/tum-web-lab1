      <h2>Descritpion</h2>
      <p>
        Software Engineer who loves building and automating scalable systems. As
        an adaptive learner, I’m always excited to join new projects, learn new
        tech, and work with new teams. <br />
        The big picture from architecture to production guides every solution I
        build, even if a small change is needed.
